To install the Remi repository for PHP on Fedora 42, you'll first need to update your system and then install the remi-release package for Fedora 42. This package provides the repository configuration and GPG key. After installation, you can enable the remi-safe or remi-modular repository and install specific PHP versions or extensions as needed. 
Code

sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y
sudo dnf install http://rpms.remirepo.net/fedora/remi-release-42.rpm -y
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled remi-safe

Explanation:

    1. sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y:
    This command updates all your system packages to the latest versions, ensuring a clean installation of the Remi repository. 

2. sudo dnf install http://rpms.remirepo.net/fedora/remi-release-42.rpm -y:
This command downloads and installs the remi-release package specifically for Fedora 42, which contains the repository configuration. 
3. sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled remi-safe:
This command enables the remi-safe repository. You can also enable remi-modular if you need to install PHP versions as Software Collections (SCL). 

Note: The remi-safe repository typically provides older PHP versions as Software Collections, while remi-modular offers newer PHP versions and allows you to manage them as modules.
